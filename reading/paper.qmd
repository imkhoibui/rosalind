## About single-cell RNA-seq

Single-cell RNA-seq consists of the following steps:

## Study overview

This paper investigates the use of anti-PD1 on breast cancer patients

## Investigative questions

### What information to gather from the paper to re-analyze the paper and use the data for future big data research purposes

Re-analyzing this paper requires:

Data:

(1) Raw-sequencing reads of scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq and CITE-seq.
The link to those data can be found 

(2) gnomAD database is used to filter tumor exome-seq data for somatic mutations.

### Can you provide an explanation of how single-cell RNA sequencing experiments were specifically designed to study the topic?

The sequencing experiments were designed as follow:

(1) Biopsies were obtained pre-treatment and on-treatment and then subjected to single-cell disassociation on ice. The cells are then filtered after removal of red blood cells and number of living cells were determined using a LUNA cell counter.

(2) Single-cell TCR-seq and 5' gene expression profiling was performed 
with upto 5000 cells are loaded to the cartridge for each sample.

(3) Performed subcluster T cells from pre- and on-treatment samples using
the integration pipeline of Seurat.


### From the paper, list the major cell types and their marker genes

Major cell types: 

- T cells, markers are: INPP5F and GPR25, ZEB2 (T_{H1}),  CCR7 and LEF1 (naive T cells markers)

- Dendritic cells, markers are: CCR7, CCL19

- Fibroblast

- Myeloid cell

- B cell

### From the paper, list the cell subtypes

T cells have the following cell subtypes:

+ Experienced T cells (T_{EX}), which were further split into type-1 helper (T_{H1}) and follicular helper (T_{FH})

+ Resident-memory T cells (T_{RM})

+ Activated effector/memory T cells (T_{EMRA})

### What information or data was NOT further investigated by the author that might hold potential for significant findings?

From the paper, I think that we can investigate further on the following:

(1)

(2)

###  What new knowledge or insights did you acquire from reading this paper, stated in your own words?

A lot, I attempted to visualize what I learned below:

(1) On various T-cell types:


(2) The process of :


(3) Cell-protein interaction:

(4)
